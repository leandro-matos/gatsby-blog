## Rich editing at your fingertips

The editor can also handle rich media objects, called **cards**.

You can insert a card either by clicking the `+` button on a new line, or typing `/` on a new line to search for a particular card. This allows you to efficiently insert **images**, **markdown**, **html** and **embeds**.

**For Example**:

* Insert a video from YouTube directly into your content by pasting the URL
* Create unique content like a button or content opt-in using the HTML card
* Need to share some code? Embed code blocks directly

# Working with images in posts

You can add images to your posts in many ways:

* Upload from your computer
* Click and drag an image into the browser
* Paste directly into the editor from your clipboard
* Insert using a URL

Once inserted you can blend images beautifully into your content at different sizes and add captions wherever needed.

settings menu and publishing options can be found in the top right hand corner. For more advanced tips on post settings check out the [publishing options](https://leandromatos.herokuapp.com/publishing-options/) post!
